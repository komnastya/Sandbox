# CREATE SINGLETON

print('\nCreate singleton:')


# A singleton is a class with only one instance. There are several singletons in Python that you use frequently,
# including None, True, and False. It is the fact that None is a singleton that allows you to compare for None
# using the is keyword.

# Using IS returns TRUE only for objects that are the exact same instance. The following @singleton decorator turns
# a class into a singleton by storing the first instance of the class as an attribute. Later attempts at creating an
# instance simply return the stored instance.

def singleton(cls):
    """Make a class a Singleton class (only one instance)"""

    @functools.wraps(cls)
    def wrapper_singleton(*args, **kwargs):
        if not wrapper_singleton.instance:
            wrapper_singleton.instance = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper_singleton.instance

    wrapper_singleton.instance = None
    return wrapper_singleton


# As you see, this class decorator follows the same template as our function decorators. The only difference is that
# we are using cls instead of func as the parameter name to indicate that it is meant to be a class decorator.

@singleton
class TheOne:
    pass


first_one = TheOne()
another_one = TheOne()

assert id(first_one) == id(another_one)
assert first_one is another_one

print('First_one id:', id(first_one))
print('Another_one id:', id(another_one))

# It seems clear that first_one is indeed the exact same instance as another_one.

# Note: Singleton classes are not really used as often in Python as in other languages. The effect of a singleton
# is usually better implemented as a global variable in a module.
